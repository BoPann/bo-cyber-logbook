Double-extortion is a tactic used by cybercriminals, particularly in ransomware attacks, where attackers not only encrypt the victim's data but also steal sensitive information. This creates a two-pronged threat: the victim must not only pay to recover their encrypted data but also to prevent the public release of their stolen information. In the provided context, the requests for sensitive files such as /logs.tar.gz and /config suggest that the attacker is preparing to execute a double-extortion scheme. They are gathering data that could be used to pressure the victim into paying a ransom. If the victim does not comply, the attacker threatens to leak this sensitive data, further increasing the chances of payment. This method of extortion intensifies the urgency for victims and complicates the response to ransomware incidents.
