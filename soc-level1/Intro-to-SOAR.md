SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It is a solution that helps organisations to streamline and automate their security operations, including incident management, threat intelligence, and vulnerability response.


SOC does many things includes detecting, monitoing, recovering, remediating, communicating... 

## Problem
With so many tasks, SOCs usually face challenge such as alert fatigue...

## Solution
With SOAR, SOC analysts do not need to switch between SIEM, EDR, Firewall, and other security tools for their investigations. It **AUTOMATE** the tasks for the analyst. It also does orchestration (the act of connecting and integrating security tools and systems into seamless workflows) and response. 

- **SIEM finds the problem. SOAR helps fix it.**
- SIEM = “Hey! Something suspicious just happened.”
- SOAR = “Got it. I’ll take care of it.”
