# Kibana

## Overview
Similar to Splunk, it allows user to visualize and analyze data. Kibana is powered by elasticsearch. Think of Kibana as the frontend and elasticsearch is the backend. 

## Key Words
- **Elasticsearch** -  is a distributed, scalable, and highly available search engine. It is used to store and index data so that it can be quickly searched and analysed.

- **Index Pattern** - similar to Splunk, index is used to search in log
- Use KQP - Kabina Query Language see: [KQL offical doc](https://www.elastic.co/docs/explore-analyze/query-filter/languages/kql)

## Description 
Typically different data will yield to different fields. The first thing we might want to look into is the **Fileds** pane on the left. This gives us an idea of what's the data look like. We can also add it to the filter by a right click!
