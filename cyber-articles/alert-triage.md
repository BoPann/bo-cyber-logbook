# Alert Truage

## Article
I’ve been thinking about how to improve my skills in **alert triage**, and I came across a video that I found really helpful.

At its core, alert triage comes down to one key question:  
**Does this alert require further investigation?**

From there, it’s about **assessing risk** and deciding what to do next.

### Three key skills for effective alert triage:

- **Knowing which logs to check**  
	- (and not getting lost in irrelevant noise)
- **Understanding the baseline**  
	- What does _normal_ activity actually look like in this environment?
- **Being able to explain your decision**  
	- Why you escalated, closed, or deprioritized the alert—in clear, defensible terms
