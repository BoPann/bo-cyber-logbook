# Google Dorking vs Gemini 

Google Dorking is the use of advanced search operators to find information that isn't easily accessible through a standard search

Even in the era of AI, Google dorking is still a thing! I ask Gemini "What are the things you can't do but google search can?" Here is the response: 

- **The "I'm Feeling Lucky" Experience:** Google Search provides direct, clickable links to billions of specific sub-pages. I often summarize or provide a few sources, but I am not an exhaustive directory.
- **Real-time Site Discovery:** If a website was created 10 minutes ago, Google Search will often index it instantly. My "knowledge" relies on a mix of training data and targeted searches; I don't "crawl" the entire live web in real-time.
- **Neutrality:** Google Search shows you exactly what is on the web, including controversial or unverified forum posts. I have safety guardrails that may prevent me from answering certain queries or "taking sides," whereas Search just shows you the data that exists.
