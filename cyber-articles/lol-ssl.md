# Lol SSL Expires 
## Articles
**All of a sudden, players couldn’t log in to League of Legends.**  
No hacking. Servers looked fine. Everything seemed normal.

So what happened?

**Someone forgot to renew a subscription.** 😭

SSL—short for "Secure Sockets Layer"—is a security protocol for establishing encrypted connections between a server and client. To form an SSL connection, the client and server verify each other's SSL certificates, which are issued by trusted third-party certificate authorities and must be regularly renewed. 

And this time they revew it for 100 years lol
