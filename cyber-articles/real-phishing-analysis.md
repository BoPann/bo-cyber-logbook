I found a YouTube video that walks through a real phishing analysis. What made it especially interesting is that it’s based on an actual incident. Seeing the concepts I’ve learned applied to a real-world example was both rewarding and motivating.

## Workflow

1. Skim the email to identify IOCs (social engineering cues, urgency, suspicious domains)
2. Inspect the raw email headers to uncover embedded links and attachments
3. Run threat intelligence checks on IPs, domains, URLs, and files
4. Detonate artifacts in a sandbox to observe behavior
