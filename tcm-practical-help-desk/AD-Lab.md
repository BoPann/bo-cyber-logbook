# AD

## Overview
It’s a giant digital guest list! You’ve got the **Domain Controller** acting like the bouncer at the velvet rope. You give him your name, he looks at his little clipboard—the **Database**—and if you’re not on the list? _No entry!_ No emails, no spreadsheets, nothing! You’re just standing in the lobby holding your briefcase like a schmuck!

### It Manages 3 major things
- **The Database (The Phonebook):** Stores "Objects" like users, computers, printers, and groups.
- **Domain Controller (The Brain):** The server that runs the AD software. When you log in, your computer asks the Domain Controller, "Is this password correct?"
- **Group Policy (The Rulebook):** These are rules admins set. (e.g., "Nobody in the Marketing department can use USB drives.")

>I personally think of it as a file management + user management + databse in linux
