## Overview
**ticketing** is the process of documenting, tracking, and resolving technical issues or requests through a centralized software system.

## Description 
When you order food (an issue), the waiter writes it down (creates a ticket) and sticks it on a rail. The chefs (IT team) read the order, prioritize it (appetizers first, then mains), cook it (fix the issue), and ding the bell when it's ready (resolve the ticket). Without this system, orders would be forgotten, customers would be angry, and the kitchen would be chaotic.

## Core Roles
- the ticket - notice of the issues
- the user - who's having issues
- the agent - who's there to help with those issues

## Life Cycle of the tickets
- creation 
- triage - who should get this ticket?
- investigation & resolution - what's going on? 
- closure - with details of steps taken

## Why is matters?
- help the help desk to keep track of the problems
- make sure no duplicate work is done
- make sure all issues won't be neglected
