# Day18 Obfuscation
>Another dat of Cyberchef!


Obfuscation is the practice of making data hard to read and analyze. Attackers use it to evade basic detection and delay investigations. In other words, it's making SOC analyst harder! 


ROT is a simple form of obfuscation. It simply rotate the letters just like caesar cipher. -> look for common pattern

XOR is a little trickier one. It use binary conversion XOR. Therefore, it can make text into something that make no sense at all.
