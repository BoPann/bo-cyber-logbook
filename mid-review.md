I once got into the trap of chasing the percentage. I use that as a evaluation of what I have learned. But quickly I realzed this is not feasible and, of course, not a effective indicator of progress. 

The real progress comes from the "struggling" which can often feel long and exhausting. But the "ah-ha" moment is when the real progress comes in. 

The most difficult part, honestly, is not "knowing" the knowledge, but being able to articulate my thought and being able to explain a concept in details. It's about connecting the dots and making sense of it.
